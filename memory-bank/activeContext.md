# Active Context: Spelling Bee Adventure (Phase 2 â€“ Scoring System Integrated)

## Current Focus
- **Phase 2: Core Gameplay - Practice Mode**
- Core gameplay loop is functional: word selection, display, input, and checking.
- **Scoring system fully implemented:** Modular config, speed bonus, streak bonus, animated feedback, and persistence.
- ScoreDisplay component provides animated breakdown of base, speed, and streak points.
- GameScreen.js manages timing, streaks, and total score, and persists each attempt's results.
- All scoring rules are now configuration-driven (see `src/config/scoringConfig.js`).
- Enhanced UI with improved styling, animations, and visual feedback.
- Game state persistence between sessions for seamless user experience.

## Recent Changes
- Created `src/config/scoringConfig.js` for all scoring parameters.
- Implemented `src/utils/scoreCalculator.js` for pure scoring logic.
- Updated `src/utils/storageManager.js` to persist detailed score breakdowns per attempt.
- Added `src/components/ScoreDisplay.js` for animated, educational feedback.
- Integrated scoring, streak, and timing logic into `GameScreen.js`.
- Enhanced UI with new CSS classes for better visual hierarchy and feedback.
- Improved error handling and loading states in App.js.
- Added game state persistence between sessions.
- Updated styling for mode indicators, score display, and buttons.

## Next Immediate Steps
1. Integrate scoring system into Test Mode and ensure correct interaction with hints and session timer.
2. Add visual/auditory rewards for milestones (e.g., streaks, high scores).
3. Display user statistics and trends using persisted score breakdowns.
4. Refactor GameScreen.js if logic grows further (consider custom hooks or context).
5. Add animations for mode transitions and score updates.
6. Implement dark mode support using CSS variables.

## Active Decisions & Considerations
- Scoring is now fully modular and configuration-driven for easy adjustment.
- Score breakdowns are persisted for future analytics and statistics.
- UI feedback is animated and educational, showing how points are earned.
- Enhanced visual hierarchy with consistent styling patterns.
- Game state persistence ensures seamless user experience between sessions.
- Error handling provides clear feedback for better user experience.

## Key Learnings/Insights
- Decoupling scoring logic from UI and gameplay enables rapid iteration and future extensibility.
- Animated feedback increases engagement and helps users understand the scoring system.

## Important Patterns/Preferences
- Maintain Memory Bank diligently after each significant step or phase completion.
- Prioritize modular, maintainable code and configuration-driven logic.
