# Product Context: Spelling Bee Adventure

## Problem Solved
A child needs an engaging and effective tool to practice a specific list of English words for an upcoming school Spelling Bee contest. The practice needs to align with the teacher's requirement of 20 minutes daily practice, focusing on correctly spelling each letter of the words when prompted.

## Target User
A single child preparing for an English Spelling Bee. The application should be intuitive and motivating for this age group.

## How it Should Work
The application presents words from the provided list one by one.
- **Practice Mode:** The child sees the word and spells it using a virtual keyboard, receiving immediate feedback per letter. They can hear the word's pronunciation.
- **Test Mode:** The child only hears the word and must spell it without visual aid. Hints are disabled.
- **Learning Mechanics:** The app tracks difficult words (based on errors) and presents them more frequently. A scoring system with bonuses and visual rewards encourages engagement. A 20-minute timer structures the practice sessions.
- **Support:** An alphabet helper shows letters and their English pronunciation. Hints are available in Practice Mode.

## User Experience Goals
- **Engaging:** Use a fun "learning adventure" theme, bright colors, an owl mascot, and positive reinforcement (sounds, animations) to keep the child motivated.
- **Educational:** Effectively teach the spelling of the target words, reinforcing correct spelling and pronunciation.
- **Simple:** Easy-to-use interface suitable for a child, with clear instructions and large interactive elements.
- **Focused:** Help the child meet the specific goal of mastering the provided word list within the 20-minute daily practice guideline.
- **Adaptive:** Adjust word presentation based on the child's performance to focus on areas needing improvement.
