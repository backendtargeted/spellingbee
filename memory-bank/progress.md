# Project Progress: Spelling Bee Adventure

## Current Status (Phase 2 â€“ Enhanced UI & State Management)
- Project foundation is set up.
- Word list data is available.
- Core gameplay loop (Practice Mode) is functional.
- **Scoring system (base, speed, streak bonuses) is fully implemented and integrated.**
- ScoreDisplay provides animated, educational feedback.
- Score breakdowns are persisted in localStorage for analytics/statistics.
- Enhanced UI with improved styling and visual feedback.
- Game state persistence between sessions implemented.
- Error handling and loading states improved.
- Memory Bank is up-to-date with recent changes.

## What Works
- React project structure (`create-react-app`).
- All Memory Bank files initialized.
- `src/data/wordList.json` populated.
- `src/utils/wordManager.js` and `src/utils/storageManager.js` (now with full score breakdown and game state support).
- `src/config/scoringConfig.js` for modular scoring rules.
- `src/utils/scoreCalculator.js` for pure scoring logic.
- `src/components/ScoreDisplay.js` for animated feedback.
- `GameScreen.js` manages timing, streaks, scoring, and persistence.
- Enhanced UI with consistent styling patterns:
  - Mode indicators with visual states
  - Improved button styling and interactions
  - Score display with animations
  - Loading and error states
- Game state persistence between sessions

## What's Next
- Integrate scoring system into Test Mode and ensure correct interaction with hints and session timer.
- Add visual/auditory rewards for correct answers and milestones (e.g., streaks, high scores).
- Display user statistics and trends using persisted score breakdowns.
- Refactor GameScreen.js if logic grows further (consider custom hooks or context).
- Add animations for mode transitions and score updates.
- Implement dark mode support using CSS variables.
- Add sound effects for user interactions and achievements.

## Completed Phases
- Phase 1: Foundation & Data Setup
- Phase 2 (partial): Core Gameplay - Practice Mode, Scoring System

## Phases Remaining
2.  Core Gameplay - Practice Mode (final polish, rewards, statistics)
3.  Test Mode & Session Timer
4.  Difficulty Tracking & Word Prioritization
5.  Hints & Advanced Scoring
6.  Styling & Theme Implementation
7.  Statistics & Final Polish
8.  Documentation Review & Handover

## Known Issues / Blockers
- None currently.

## Key Decisions Log
- Decision: Use `create-react-app` in a subdirectory (`spellingbee/`) due to naming constraints. (Phase 1)
- Decision: Target a single user, removing the need for profile management. (Planning Phase)
- Decision: Store word list in `wordList.json`. (Planning Phase)
- Decision: Use `localStorage` for persistence. (Planning Phase)
- Decision: Use Web Speech API for TTS. (Planning Phase)
- **Decision: Implement modular, config-driven scoring system with animated feedback and detailed persistence. (Phase 2)**
- **Decision: Enhance UI with consistent styling patterns and improved visual feedback. (Phase 2)**
- **Decision: Implement comprehensive game state persistence for seamless user experience. (Phase 2)**
