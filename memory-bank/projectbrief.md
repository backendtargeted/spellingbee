# Project Brief: Spelling Bee Adventure

## Core Goal
Develop a React-based web application to help a single child practice English spelling words for a Spelling Bee contest.

## Key Requirements
- Use the specific word list provided.
- Implement Practice Mode (word visible) and Test Mode (word hidden, audio only).
- Include Text-to-Speech (TTS) pronunciation for words (en-US accent).
- Provide a virtual keyboard for spelling input.
- Offer visual feedback for correct/incorrect letters.
- Include an Alphabet Helper with letter pronunciations.
- Implement a scoring system with base points, speed bonus, and streak bonus.
- Provide visual/auditory rewards for correct answers and milestones.
- Implement a hint system (first letter, word length) with point cost and session limits (disabled in Test Mode).
- Track "difficult words" (failed >= 2 times) and prioritize them in practice.
- Include a 20-minute session timer.
- Persist progress (score, word stats) using `localStorage`.
- Feature a child-friendly "learning adventure" theme with bright colors, an owl mascot, and responsive design.
- Implement light/dark mode.
- Display user statistics (mastered words, difficult words, accuracy).
- Ensure clean, modular code using React Hooks.
- Target a single user (no multi-profile system).
